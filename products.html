                  PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTION:-  Iron maintains healthy red blood cells and therefore assists with the transport of oxygen throughout the body. Cyanocobalamin and folic acid help cell metabolism, DNA synthesis and haemopoiesis. Deficiencies of both Cyanocobalamin and folic acid are common due to dietary inadequacies and particularly to infants born to mothers who are grossly deficient in folate or vitamin B12 during pregnancy. Supplementation of both folic acid and Cyanocobalamin is therefore necessary in such cases to prevent nutritional megaloblastic anaemia. Lysine provides dietary supplement, increasing appetite and weight gain in children.
                  
                  INDICATIONS:-  MARCRICH TONIC is indicated for;
                  
                  -The treatment of common iron deficiency anaemia due to chronic blood loss, inadequate intake of iron, hook-worm infestation etc

                  - Anaemia of pregnancy and lactation
                  
                  - Increased iron demand during convalescence from prolonged illness and other debilitating conditions
                  
                  - Anaemia due to excessive or repeated haemorrhage, post-surgical conditions and others

          PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTION:- MARCNOL is a combination of Amlodipine and Ramipril. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. Amlodipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Inhibition is selective, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. Unlike the first generation dihydropyridines, it doesn’t cause reflex tachycardia. Amlodipine acts directly on vascular smooth muscle leading to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and a subsequent reduction in BP. Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a higher potency compare to lisinopril. It help with renal protection through inhibition of direct renal vasoconstriction by angiotensin .

          <p class="tablet-body">The combination of low dose Amlodipine and Ramipril significantly reduces cough associated with the use of ramipril through inhibition of PG synthesis ( Forgari, R et al (91999).
